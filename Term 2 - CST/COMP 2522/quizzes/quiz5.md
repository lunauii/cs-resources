# Quiz 5: Collections

- Create a class called `Test`. It has a `main()` method in which the following must happen.<br>
Create a HashMap of values: 1->"one", 2->"two", 3->"three", 4->"four", and 5->"five".<br>
Then create a set of map's keys, and use an iterator to print all the values that contain the letter "o".<br>
Also put those "o" values into an array called `containsO`.
Then use a for-each loop to iterate through the array and add each value to an ArrayList called `hasO`.<br>
Use all of the best practices that we use in class (except JavaDocs) and make sure your code handles null values properly. **(12/12)**
