# Quiz 4: Interfaces

- Create two interfaces; one is called File; the other is Bank. Both have a concrete method called `save(String)` plus another method of your choosing. Bank just prints "saved money to account number xyz" (xyz is the argument; the String account number). The File `save()` prints "saved fata to file xyz" (the argument is a filename String). The create a class OnlineBankAccount that implements both interfaces. The OnlineBankAccount overrides the `save()` method to perform the Bank version. **(7/8)**

- True or false: a class can implement multiple interfaces. **(1/8)**

**Solution**: True
