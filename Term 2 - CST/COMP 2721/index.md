## Course Description
> Computer organization is a fundamental topic for computer science students and for any future programmers. The course gives a good understanding of the computer hardware and how software is built on a specific hardware. The computer is regarded as a hierarchy of levels, each one performing some well-defined functions from the device level (hardware) to the problem-oriented language level. Each level is discussed and analyzed in detail.

Computer Organization/Architecture is an intensive introduction course that covers the foundations of hardware, networking, circuitry, and low level programming with Assembly. 

Succeeding in this course requires you to memorize and understand diagrams, in addition to the underlying purpose of all the components covered.
