## Course Description
> Computer organization is a fundamental topic for computer science students and for any future programmers. The course gives a good understanding of the computer hardware and how software is built on a specific hardware. The computer is regarded as a hierarchy of levels, each one performing some well-defined functions from the device level (hardware) to the problem-oriented language level. Each level is discussed and analyzed in detail.

Computer Organization/Architecture is an intensive course that covers hardware, circuitry, and low level languages such as Assembly. It is
