# CS Resources
!!!warning
**WIP** <br>
This page is a work in progress. Feel free to help contribute by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/lunauii/bcit-resources/pulls)!
!!!

A resource for all things Computer Science for the British Columbia Institution of Technology (BCIT) Computer System Technology Dipolma (CST) program and other CS-related programs at BCIT.

Made by CST students, for CST students; this site aims at providing up to date resources on things in CST such as student-made notes, instructor details, and other key information needed for CST.

While this database is aimed towards CST students, this site can also be used by other CS program students or anyone wanting to learn computer science! We hope that this website helps with your CS needs. ❤️
