#### Learning Resources

* Lecture Notes to Accompany COMP 1113 by **Goran Ruzic**, available for purchase at the Burnaby bookstore during the first week of classes.

* Mobius Access code, available for purchase from Burnaby bookstore during the first week of classes.

* A scientific calculator (with logarithmic, exponential and base conversion functions). Recommended: SHARP Advanced D.A.L EL-520 or 546 (it has cool solver features). SHARP 531 is a less ideal alternative since it does not have solver but otherwise works well for this course. If you have another calculator that you are comfortable using, you may use that instead of the recommended calculator.

## Course Description
> Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.
