The **Crescent Difficulty Index** (CDI) is an informal unit of measuring a course's difficulty based on 3 factors:
### Load
> This factor is influenced by how often and clustered coursework such as quizzes, labs, assignments, and projects are as well as how long it averagely takes to complete them. For group projects, it is also determined by how often each group member needs to spend on it per week.
### Complexity
> This factor is influenced by how difficult the material in a course is relative to a student without prior experience in the field, as well as how difficult the topic is in general.
### Strain
> This factor is mostly based on the public opinion of the instructor, the quality of the lectures/labs relative to how much you need to study it outside of them, and the clarity of instructions as a whole. This factor has the least weight due to its high variability.
## Ratings
After considering all these factors, the ratings are then given based on how much the factors are present.
